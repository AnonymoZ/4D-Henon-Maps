Blank folder named 'Henon' in the directory of the script, and Resume.txt even if empty are REQUIRED for the code. But Render Log.txt is optional to have, as it will create it anyway.

**Chaos** is the evolution of a system in ways that are *unpredictable*.<br> “Evolution” means a change of the system's state whenever the system's variables are increased.<br><br>
Many people are amazed by Chaotic visuals and think that what they see is the system. This is not true! The entire system has only one state therefore one coordinate at a time. Whatever else of vast imagery you see is just the *history* of the system!<br><br>
Another misconception people have is believing *Chaos* means ‘total disorder.’ Not true again! Chaotic systems that we study always evolve within *known confines* albeit not evolving sequentially and they also always follow the rules of the system.<br><br>
There are two kinds of Chaotic systems:<br>
- Systems whose states are governed by *iterative formulae*.<br>
 *In which you take the coordinates of the system's state and put it back in the equations to draw a new state, and repeat.*
- Systems whose states are governed by *differential equations*.<br>
 *In which you increase the variables you control (for example* time) *and watch the system respond to your increases.*
